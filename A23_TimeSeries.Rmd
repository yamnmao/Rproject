#A23_Pair12
##Do a time series analysis of the average daily price.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
t <- read_csv("/Users/apple/Assignment/Dataset/electricityprices.csv")
t$Day <- mday(t$timestamp)
t$Hour <- hour(t$timestamp)
t$Month <- month(t$timestamp) 
t$Year <- year(t$timestamp)
t <-t %>% group_by(Year, Month, Day) %>% summarize(AverageDailyPrice = mean(cost))
```
##Use dygraph to produce a plot
```{r}
library(dygraphs)
ts <-  ts(t$AverageDailyPrice,start=c(1),frequency=1)
head(ts)
dygraph(ts)

#The eighth day of a month is the 
```
##Conclusions:
The electricity pirces vary depends on different period of a year. The highest price happens in the 6th month, and it might be caused by the summer time.
